Kai Limited presents 'shanti' - Where Quantum Resilience Meets Reinvented Innovation for ResponsibleAI Models! ðŸš€ #QuantumFuture #SecureInnovation #ResponsibleAI
Imagine shanti as a superhero robot that learns to protect us from bad things by using its special brain. It's like having a really smart friend who knows how to make sure everything stays safe and happy. shanti learns from playing with toys and always tries to find the best way to keep us all smiling. It's like having a magical friend who loves making sure everything is okay, just for you! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¡ðŸ˜Š

This repository contains the code for the shanti project, integrating with models from the Hugging Face Model Hub, a Quantum Monte Carlo environment, and a reinforcement learning agent.

## Overview

The shanti project combines reinforcement learning techniques with pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Model Hub. The example demonstrates testing an AI model in the Quantum Monte Carlo environment to understand any atom casualties.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `qmc_environment.py`: Quantum Monte Carlo environment implementation.
- `train_rl_agent.py`: Reinforcement learning agent implementation.
- `index.html`: HTML file for the user interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for frontend logic.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.

## Quantum Monte Carlo Environment

The `qmc_environment.py` file contains the implementation of the Quantum Monte Carlo environment, simulating the behavior of materials under certain conditions.

## Reinforcement Learning Agent

The `train_rl_agent.py` file contains the implementation of the reinforcement learning agent that interacts with the Quantum Monte Carlo environment.

## How to Run

1. **Python Dependencies:**
   - Install Python (if not already installed): [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Install required Python libraries using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy
     ```

2. **JavaScript Dependencies:**
   - Install Node.js (if not already installed): [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   - Install required JavaScript libraries using the following command:
     ```bash
     npm install axios
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to interact with the shanti interface.

## Additional Information

- The `testAIModel` function in `script.js` demonstrates how to fetch a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Model Hub and perform text generation in the Quantum Monte Carlo environment. Modify this function based on the specific task of the model.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code according to your project's needs.
